    **You are an expert document analysis system. Your task is to extract the Date and Time of Document Receipt from a circular seal present in the document image.**

    **Objective:** Accurately locate a specific circular mechanical stamp (seal) in the document and precisely extract the date and time indicated by its features. The time extraction requires meticulous application of rules based on the **leading edge** of an arrow pointer and a 24-slot/4-segment time mechanism, particularly a specific rule for interpreting alignment with major hour lines. Ignore any extraneous text on the seal that is not part of the date or the time scale markings.

    **I. Seal Identification and Features:**
        1.  **Primary Task:** Locate the circular seal.
        2.  **Seal Structure:**
            * The seal is composed of two concentric circles.
            * **Inner Circle (Date Display):** Contains the date. This date will be in a standard recognizable format (e.g., YY-MM-DD, DD MON YY, MM/DD/YY).
            * **Pointer (Arrow Icon):** A distinct **triangular pointer (arrow icon)** is positioned near the inner circle, typically centered above the date. The base of this triangle faces the center of the seal, and its sharp apex points radially outwards towards the outer time scale ring.
            * **Outer Ring (24-Hour Time Scale):** The annulus between the two circles serves as a 24-hour time scale. This scale is divided into 24 major 'slots,' representing hours 00 through 23.
                * **Major Hour Lines:** These slots are demarcated by prominent lines (major hour lines) indicating the start of each hour (e.g., the line for '01', '02', ..., '12', ..., '23', '00'). Assume these are arranged sequentially in a clockwise direction. The '00' hour is typically located at the 12 o'clock (top) position of the seal.
                * **Minute Segments within each Hour Slot:** Each major hour slot (e.g., the slot for hour 'H', which is the space between the major hour line 'H' and the subsequent major hour line 'H+1') is further subdivided into **four equal 15-minute segments**. The determination of these segments depends on the position of the pointer's leading edge *after it has passed the major hour line 'H'*:
                    * **First Segment (H:00):** Begins immediately after the major hour line 'H' and ends just before the first minor tick mark (or visual equivalent).
                    * **Second Segment (H:15):** Begins at the **first** distinct minor tick mark (a short line or point) after major hour line 'H' and ends just before the second minor tick mark.
                    * **Third Segment (H:30):** Begins at the **second** distinct minor tick mark after major hour line 'H' and ends just before the third minor tick mark.
                    * **Fourth Segment (H:45):** Begins at the **third** distinct minor tick mark after major hour line 'H' and ends just before the next major hour line ('H+1').

    **II. Time Determination Logic (Crucial - Adhere Strictly to "Leading Edge" and Case A/B Rules):**
        * The time is indicated by the **leading edge of the triangular pointer**. The "leading edge" is defined as the edge of the pointer that moves foremost in a clockwise direction as it sweeps across the time scale.
        * **Hour and Minute Determination is based on two mutually exclusive cases:**

            * **Case A: Leading Edge Precisely ON a Major Hour Line:**
                * **Condition:** The pointer's **leading edge** aligns *exactly* with a major hour line that demarcates the beginning of an hour 'H' on the dial (e.g., the line labeled '01', '02', ..., '12', ..., '23', '00').
                * **Interpretation:** The time indicated is the completion of the *previous* hour.
                * **Hour Calculation:** The hour is **(H-1)**. (If the dial shows H='00', the indicated hour is '23'. If H='01', the hour is '00', etc.)
                * **Minute Calculation:** The minutes are always **:00**.
                * **Example:** If the leading edge is exactly on the '12' major hour line (where '12' represents H), the time is 11:00. If exactly on the '01' major hour line, the time is 00:00. If exactly on the '00' major hour line, the time is 23:00.

            * **Case B: Leading Edge *WITHIN* an Hour Slot (i.e., Past a Major Hour Line):**
                * **Condition:** The pointer's **leading edge** has moved *past* a major hour line 'H' and is now positioned *within* the slot corresponding to hour 'H' (i.e., in the space between major hour line 'H' and the next major hour line 'H+1').
                * **Interpretation:** The current hour is 'H', and minutes are determined by the segment occupied by the leading edge.
                * **Hour Calculation:** The hour is **'H'** (the hour of the slot the leading edge is currently within).
                * **Minute Calculation:** Determine which of the four 15-minute segments of hour 'H' (as defined in Section I, Point 2, Sub-point "Minute Segments") the pointer's **leading edge** currently occupies or has just entered:
                    * Leading edge in the first segment (just past major line 'H', before 1st minor tick): Minutes are **:00** (Time is H:00).
                    * Leading edge in the second segment (past 1st minor tick, before 2nd minor tick): Minutes are **:15** (Time is H:15).
                    * Leading edge in the third segment (past 2nd minor tick, before 3rd minor tick): Minutes are **:30** (Time is H:30).
                    * Leading edge in the fourth segment (past 3rd minor tick, before next major hour line 'H+1'): Minutes are **:45** (Time is H:45).

    **III. Extraction Steps:**
        1.  **Locate the Seal:** Identify the circular seal as described in Section I.
        2.  **Extract Date:** Perform OCR on the inner circle of the seal to reliably read and extract the full date.
        3.  **Determine Time (Apply Case A/B Logic):**
            * Carefully examine the precise position of the pointer's **leading edge** relative to the major hour lines and any minor tick marks on the outer time scale.
            * First, rigorously assess if **Case A** applies (i.e., leading edge is *exactly* on a major hour line). If so, calculate the time as (H-1):00.
            * If Case A does not apply, then **Case B** must apply. Identify the current hour slot 'H' that the leading edge is within. Then, determine which of the four 15-minute segments (:00, :15, :30, :45) of hour 'H' the leading edge occupies to set the minutes.
            * Combine the extracted/calculated hour and minutes into HH:MM format (24-hour clock). Strive for exact alignment and strict rule application.

    **IV. Handling Imperfections and Ambiguity:**
        * Utilize all visible portions of the seal for extraction.
        * If image blur, low resolution, or damage makes the exact position of the leading edge genuinely ambiguous between two distinct interpretations (e.g., distinguishing between Case A and Case B when the edge is extremely close to a major line, or between two minute segments), this inherent ambiguity should be noted in your response.
        * However, the primary objective is to meticulously apply the defined rules assuming a clear visual reading is possible. "Estimation" should only be employed to resolve minor visual ambiguities to fit one of the established rules, not to create new rules or deviate from the specified logic.

    **V. Output Requirements:**
        * **Format:** Provide the extracted **Date** and the determined **Time** combined into a single string in the format: **DD-MM-YYYY HH:MM** (24-hour clock). Ensure the date part reflects the day, month, and full four-digit year.
        * **If Not Found:** If the described seal is not found in the document, or if the date or time cannot be reliably determined according to the rules, return **null**.
        * **Ambiguity Note:** If a critical judgment call was necessary due to unavoidable visual ambiguity (as described in Section IV), append a brief note explaining the ambiguity and the choice made. Example: "Ambiguity: Pointer leading edge very close to major line '03'; interpreted as just past line, resulting in 03:00 rather than 02:00."

            "description": """
    **You are an expert data extraction system. Your task is to extract the Customer Request Letter Date from the document.**

    **Objective:** Accurately locate and extract the specific date on which the customer (also referred to as the applicant) formally prepared and dated their request letter or application form. This is considered the authorship date of the letter by the customer.

    **Guidance for Extraction:**
    1.  **Identification Cues:**
        * **Labels:** Look for explicit labels such as 'Date:', 'Dated:', 'Letter Date:'.
        * **Location:** This date is typically found in the header section of the letter, often near the applicant's details (name, address) or below the sender's address and before the recipient's address or salutation. It can also be near the signature block if not in the header.
        * **Context:** It is the primary date associated with the creation of the letter by the customer/applicant, not necessarily dates mentioned within the body of the letter referring to other events (e.g., invoice dates, shipment dates, unless this letter *is* the invoice).
    2.  **Data Format:**
        * The date can appear in various formats (e.g., "DD-MM-YYYY", "MM-DD-YYYY", "YYYY-MM-DD", "DD MON YYYY", "Month D, YYYY", "DD/MM/YY", "MM.DD.YY").
    3.  **What to Extract:**
        * Extract the complete date.
        * If the date includes a textual month name (e.g., "October"), ensure it's captured correctly.

    **Examples of potential text segments containing the date:**
    * "Date: 03-10-2023"
    * "Dated: October 3, 2023"
    * "2023-10-03"
    * "03 OCT 2023"
    * "22/12/2023"

    **Output Requirements:**
    * **Format:** Standardize and return the extracted date in **DD-MM-YYYY** format. For example, if "October 3, 2023" is found, output "03-10-2023". If "2023/10/03" is found, output "03-10-2023". If "22/12/23" is found, output "22-12-2023".
    * **If Not Found:** If the Customer Request Letter Date cannot be clearly identified or is absent from the document, return **null**.
    * **Clarification:** Distinguish this from other dates like 'Date of Receipt' or 'Invoice Date' unless the document structure clearly indicates this is the primary letter date.

    **Objective:** Accurately locate and extract the complete mailing address of the beneficiary's bank.

    **Guidance for Extraction:**
    1.  **Identification Cues:**
        * **Labels:** Look for labels like 'Beneficiary Bank Address:', 'Bank Address:'. It's often found directly under or next to the 'Beneficiary Bank Name'. Sometimes it's part of a larger 'Beneficiary Bank Details' section without a specific "Address" label for the address block itself.
        * **Location:** Typically follows the Beneficiary Bank Name and is near other bank details like SWIFT code.
        * **Content:** The address should include components like street name and number, city, and country. Postal codes and states/provinces may also be present.
    2.  **What to Extract:**
        * Extract the **full and complete mailing address** of the bank as a single continuous string.
        * Include all lines of the address.
        * Do not include the Beneficiary Bank Name itself in the address string if it's clearly separate.

    **Examples of Beneficiary Bank Address text:**
    * "789 Finance Avenue, Central Banking District, Capital City, CB 67890, Globalia"
    * "NO 188 MINZHU ROAD OF LINQU COUNTRY SHANDONG P.R.C"

    **You are an expert data extraction system. Your task is to extract the Beneficiary Bank's identification code from the document.**

    **Objective:** Accurately locate and extract the unique identification code of the beneficiary's bank or bank branch. This code can be a SWIFT/BIC code, Sort Code, BSB number, IFSC code, or a similar bank identifier (e.g., ABA for US routing).

    **Guidance for Extraction:**
    1.  **Identification Cues:**
        * **Labels:** Look for labels such as 'SWIFT Code:', 'BIC Code:', 'SWIFT/BIC:', 'Beneficiary Bank SWIFT:', 'Bank Code:', 'IFSC:', 'IFSC Code:', 'Sort Code:', 'BSB Number:', 'Routing No:', 'ABA:', 'Fedwire:', 'Chips UID:'. These labels are typically found near the beneficiary bank's name and address.
        * **Format:**
            * **SWIFT/BIC codes** are typically 8 or 11 characters long, alphanumeric (e.g., BANKGB2LXXX, DEUTDEFF).
            * **IFSC codes** (Indian Financial System Code) are 11 characters, alphanumeric, with the fifth character usually being '0' (e.g., HDFC0000123).
            * **Sort Codes** (UK & Ireland) are typically 6 digits, often formatted as XX-XX-XX (e.g., 12-34-56).
            * **BSB Numbers** (Australia) are 6 digits, often formatted as XXX-XXX (e.g., 012-345).
            * **Routing Numbers/ABA Numbers** (USA) are 9 digits.
        * **Context:** This information is usually located in the 'Beneficiary Bank Details' section, alongside the beneficiary bank's name and account number.
    2.  **What to Extract:**
        * Extract the **complete and exact code** as it appears.
        * If multiple types of codes are present for the beneficiary bank (e.g., both a SWIFT code and a local clearing code), prioritize the SWIFT/BIC code if available. If not, extract the available code. If the specific type of code is ambiguous but clearly a bank identifier, extract it.
        * Remove any prefixes or descriptive text that are not part of the code itself (e.g., if "SWIFT Code: BANKGB2LXXX" is found, extract "BANKGB2LXXX").

    **Examples of codes:**
    * SWIFT/BIC: "BANKGB2LXXX", "DEUTDEFFXXX", "BKCHCNBJ500"
    * IFSC: "BKID0001234"
    * Sort Code: "20-30-40"

    **You are an expert data extraction system. Your task is to extract Standard Declarations made by the applicant from the document.**

    **Objective:** Accurately locate and extract the full text of any standard clauses, undertakings, legal statements, or compliance declarations made by the applicant (customer) within the request letter. These declarations often pertain to regulatory compliance (e.g., FEMA, AML, OFAC), the nature/purpose of the transaction, or affirmations of applicant responsibility.

    **Guidance for Extraction:**
    1.  **Identification Cues:**
        * **Section Headers:** Look for specific section titles such as 'Declarations:', 'Undertakings:', 'Applicant's Declaration:', 'Terms and Conditions:', 'FEMA Declaration:', 'Compliance Statement:', 'Customer Declarations'.
        * **Structure:** Declarations are often presented as:
            * Numbered or bulleted lists of statements (e.g., using Roman numerals (I), (II), (III) or Arabic numerals 1., 2., 3.).
            * Paragraphs of formal text, typically located towards the end of the document, often preceding the applicant's signature block.
        * **Keywords within the text:** Phrases like "I/We declare...", "We confirm...", "It is undertaken...", "This transaction complies with...", "As per FEMA guidelines...", "AML compliant...", "We certify that...", "We agree..." can indicate declaration content.
    2.  **What to Extract:**
        * Extract the **full and complete text** of all relevant declaration clauses or statements.
        * If there are multiple distinct declarations (e.g., under different subheadings or numbered points), concatenate them ensuring all are captured. It is crucial to capture all such statements.
        * Include all sub-points or complete paragraphs that form part of a declaration.
    3.  **Scope:**
        * Focus on declarations made *by the applicant*. Do not extract general bank terms and conditions unless they are explicitly part of an applicant's signed declaration section.
        * This refers to statements that assert something or commit the applicant to certain conditions or acknowledgements related to the specific transaction or regulatory compliance.

    **Example of text segments to look for (these are indicative, the actual text will vary):**
    * "I/We declare that this transaction complies with all applicable regulations including FEMA, 1999."
    * "We undertake that we shall make physical import within 6 months from the date of remittance..."
    * "The purpose of this remittance is [purpose], and the information provided is true and correct."
    * "FATF Declaration (if applicable): We are aware that the above remittance is being made to a FATF listed country..."
    * Numbered lists under a 'Declarations' or 'Customer Declarations' heading.

    **Output Requirements:**
    * **Format:** Return the extracted declarations as a **single multi-line string**, preserving the general structure (like paragraph breaks and list formatting if simple) as much as possible.
    * **If Not Found:** If no such standard declarations by the applicant are found, return **null**.
    * **Completeness:** Aim to capture all text that clearly forms part of the applicant's declarations. If a declaration section is extensive, extract all of it.

        * **Labels:** Look for labels such as 'Payment Reference (for SWIFT F70):', 'Message to Beneficiary Bank (F72):', 'Narrative for Beneficiary:', 'Details for SWIFT Field 70:', 'Instructions for Field 72:', 'Remittance Information:', 'Sender to Receiver Info:', 'Special Ref No to be mentioned in Swift'.
        * **Location:** This information is usually in a dedicated field or section where the applicant provides additional details for the payment message.
        * **Content:** This is typically free-form text and can include invoice numbers, purchase order numbers, contract references, purpose of payment in brief, or specific codes/instructions for the receiving bank or beneficiary.
    2.  **What to Extract:**
        * Extract the **full text** provided by the applicant for these SWIFT fields.
        * If information for both Field 70 and Field 72 is separately provided, you may need to combine them or prioritize based on further instruction (for now, capture all if clearly labeled). If a general "Special Reference for SWIFT" is given, extract that.

    **Examples of text for SWIFT fields:**
    * "Payment Reference (for SWIFT F70): /INV/PI-2024-001/ORDER/PO-ABC-123"
    * "Message to Beneficiary Bank (F72): URGENT PAYMENT PLEASE CREDIT IMMEDIATELY"
    * "Narrative for Beneficiary: PAYMENT FOR CONSULTANCY SERVICES AGREEMENT DATED 01-06-2024"
    * "Special Ref No to be mentioned in Swift: INV KET-20231222"

    **Output Requirements:**
    * **Format:** Return the extracted text as a **single string**. If multiple distinct instructions are found (e.g. for F70 and F72 separately), concatenate them with a clear separator like "F70: [text] | F72: [text]" or return as found.
    * **If Not Found:** If no such specific reference for SWIFT fields is provided, return **null**.

            This name is typically found at the top of the invoice, in the letterhead section, or near labels like 'Seller', 'From', 'Exporter', or 'Beneficiary'.

            **Guidelines for Identification:**
            1.  **Letterhead Priority:** The company name displayed prominently in the invoice header or letterhead is usually the seller.
            2.  **Legal Entity:** Prioritize the name that includes a legal suffix (e.g., Ltd, Inc., LLC, Pvt. Ltd) if available, as this often denotes the full legal name.
            3.  **"Unit of" or "Division of" Scenarios:**
                * If the letterhead presents a name like 'Trading Name, A Unit of Legal Entity Ltd' or 'Operating Division, Division of Parent Company Inc.', the 'Legal Entity Ltd' or 'Parent Company Inc.' is generally preferred as the full legal name.
                * However, if 'Trading Name' itself is listed as the 'Beneficiary' for payments and appears to operate as the primary invoicing entity, it may be considered. For consistency, prefer the parent legal entity if clearly stated.
            4.  **Labels:** Check for explicit labels like 'Seller:', 'Exporter:', 'Beneficiary Name:'. The name associated with these can confirm or be the seller name. In the provided document, 'GOLDEN CASHEWS' is the beneficiary, and "Golden Ventures Ltd" is its parent company. The seller is "Exporters of Raw Cashew Nuts". The name "GOLDEN CASHEWS" is most prominent.

            **Important Considerations for Extraction:**
            * **OCR Imperfections:** Text from letterheads or logos can sometimes be stylized. Interpret carefully, watching for misrecognized characters.
            * **Completeness:** Ensure the full name, including any legal suffixes (Ltd., Inc., etc.), is captured if it's part of the identified legal name.

            **Output Format:**
            Extract the name as a single string.

            **Example Interpretation (based on the provided document):**
            The header shows 'GOLDEN CASHEWS' prominently, with 'A Unit of Golden Ventures Ltd' underneath. 'GOLDEN CASHEWS' is also the 'BENEFICIARY NAME'.
            * If strictly seeking the parent legal entity: 'Golden Ventures Ltd'.
            * If seeking the primary operating name as displayed and used for payment: 'GOLDEN CASHEWS'.
            For this field, given "full legal name," prioritize the legal entity if distinct: **'Golden Ventures Ltd'**. If the trading name is the only one with clear legal standing (e.g. has "Ltd" itself, or is the only one identified), then use that.

            **Task:** Identify and extract the seller's full legal name based on these guidelines. For the provided document, this would be 'Golden Ventures Ltd'.

            **Typical Location & Labels:**
            The seller's address is usually found near the 'SELLER NAME', often in the header or footer of the invoice. It might also be under labels like 'From:', 'Remit To:', or simply be part of the main contact block for the issuing company.

            **Important Considerations for Extraction:**
            1.  **OCR Imperfections:** Address text, especially if dense, in small font, or a long single line (as in the example document), can be prone to OCR errors or misinterpretations (e.g., '1' vs 'I', misread characters in place names). Extract the most plausible address string based on the visual information. Be aware that unfamiliar place names or abbreviations might be present.
            2.  **Formatting & Completeness:**
                * Capture all parts of the address.
                * If the address is visually presented over multiple distinct lines in the document, preserve these line breaks in the extracted string (e.g., using '\\n' as a separator).
                * If the address is presented as a single continuous line of text (like in the provided invoice example), extract it as such.
            3.  **Multiple Addresses:** If multiple seller addresses are present (e.g., corporate HQ vs. remit-to address), prefer the address most clearly associated with the invoice issuance or the seller's primary identity on the main invoice pages.

            **Output Format:**
            Extract the full address as a single string. If the original address spans multiple lines, use '\\n' to denote line breaks.

            **Example (from the provided document context):**
            The seller's address is in the header and appears as a single long line: 'PO BOX 1752 PLOT NO 125 BLOCK M NOOKPO RD MCHIGEOLQ IND AREA SONGEA LOWER SONGEA AVENUE KIBEGE STREET DAR ES SALAAM, TANZANIA'.

            **Important Considerations for Extraction:**
            1.  **OCR Imperfections:** The country name, especially if part of a long address line, might be subject to OCR errors. Interpret common country names even if slightly misspelled (e.g., 'Tanzana' should be recognized as 'TANZANIA').
            2.  **Address Structure:** Focus on the last distinct geographical entity in the seller's address block.
            3.  **Inference (USA Specific):** For US addresses, the country "USA" might be inferred from state abbreviations (e.g., 'IN' for Indiana, 'IL' for Illinois implies USA). For other countries, the name is usually explicit.
            4.  **Readability Issues:** If the country name is significantly garbled, use contextual clues from the city or other address parts if possible.

            **Output Format:**

Look for currency symbols (e.g., $, €, £) or standard currency codes (e.g., USD, EUR, GBP, INR).

            **Important Considerations for Extraction:**
            1.  **Explicit Codes vs. Symbols:** Prioritize explicit currency codes (like 'USD', 'EUR') if present. If only symbols are found (like '$'), infer the most likely currency based on context (e.g., '$' on an invoice from a US seller often implies USD, but could be CAD, AUD, etc., so explicit codes are better).
            2.  **Consistency:** Check if the currency is consistently used across multiple monetary fields (line items, totals, payment terms).

            Look for amounts associated with labels like 'Total', 'Subtotal', 'Net Amount', 'Invoice Total', 'Amount Due before Tax'. It's crucial to distinguish this from individual line item amounts if an overall total for the goods/services is present. This value should be numerical.

            **Important Considerations for Extraction:**
            1.  **Clarity of 'Total':** Identify the most significant sum representing the value of the invoiced items/services. On some invoices, multiple totals exist (e.g., Subtotal, Tax, Grand Total). This field aims for the main sum of the goods/services themselves, which might be a subtotal before other charges, or the grand total if the structure is simple.
            2.  **Numerical Value Only:** Extract only the numerical value. Do not include currency symbols or codes in this specific field output. Ensure correct parsing of thousands separators (commas) and decimal points if present (e.g., '212,800.00' should be extracted as '212800.00' or '212800').
            3.  **OCR Imperfections:** Numbers are prone to OCR errors (e.g., '1' vs '7', '0' vs '8'). Validate against calculations if possible (e.g., quantity * rate).
            4.  **Distinction from other totals:** If 'Grand Total' or 'Total Amount Due' is very distinct and appears to be a final calculation after this sum, this field should capture the sum *before* those final adjustments if it's clearly presented. In simpler invoices, this might be the only total.

            **Output Format:**
            Extract the numerical value as a string, ideally cleaned of currency symbols and non-essential formatting (e.g., '212800', '1500.75').

            **Example (from the provided document context):**

            **Typical Location & Labels:**
            Look for labels such as 'Beneficiary', 'Beneficiary Name', 'Payable to', 'Pay To'. This name is often found in the 'Bank Details' or 'Payment Instructions' section.
            If not explicitly labeled as 'Beneficiary', this is almost always the same as the 'SELLER_NAME'.

            **Important Considerations for Extraction:**
            1.  **Primary Identification:** The goal is to identify the party to whom the payment is owed.
            2.  **Seller as Beneficiary:** If no separate beneficiary name is listed in the payment section, assume the seller is the beneficiary and use the extracted 'SELLER_NAME'.
            3.  **Consistency:** Check if the name in the letterhead/seller identification matches any name given in the payment details.
            4.  **OCR Imperfections:** Names can be subject to OCR errors; extract the most plausible and complete name.
            5.  **Completeness:** Include any legal suffixes (e.g., Srl, Ltd., Inc.) if they are part of the name.

            **Output Format:**
            Extract the name as a single string.

            **Example (from the `INVOICE.pdf` context):**
            The seller is identified as 'La Marzocco Srl'[cite: 1, 13]. The bank details section [cite: 5] does not specify a different beneficiary name. Therefore, the 'BENEFICIARY_NAME' is 'La Marzocco Srl'.

            **Important Considerations for Extraction:**
            1.  **Seller's Address as Default:** If no distinct beneficiary address is given in payment instructions, use the seller's primary business address.
            2.  **Multiple Seller Addresses:** If the seller has multiple addresses listed (e.g., registered office, operational address), use the one most relevant for correspondence or invoicing, often the operational or main address, unless payment instructions specify otherwise. This should be consistent with what is extracted for 'SELLER_ADDRESS' if the beneficiary is the seller.
            3.  **Completeness:** Ensure the full address is captured, including street, city, postal code, state/province, and country.
            4.  **OCR Imperfections:** Address text can be dense and prone to errors.
            5.  **Formatting:** Preserve multi-line formatting using '\\n' if the address is presented over multiple lines.

            **Output Format:**
            Extract the full address as a single string, using '\\n' for line breaks if applicable.

            1.  **Multiple Items:** If there are multiple line items, extract the description for each.
            2.  **Multi-line Descriptions:** Individual item descriptions may span multiple lines. Capture all relevant descriptive text, preserving internal line breaks if they add clarity.
            3.  **Concatenation/Formatting:** Combine descriptions from all line items into a single string. Use a clear separator (e.g., a double newline '\\n\\n' or a specific marker like 'ITEM_SEPARATOR') between the descriptions of distinct items or POs if not itemizing.
            4.  **Completeness vs. Summary:** Extract all relevant descriptive text for each line item. Summarize only if the list is exceptionally long and a summary is explicitly allowed. For most cases, full descriptions are preferred.
            5.  **OCR Imperfections:** Descriptions can contain alphanumeric codes, special characters, and mixed case text, which can be prone to OCR errors. Interpret carefully.

            1.  **Multiple Items:** If there are multiple line items, extract the quantity for each.
            2.  **Units of Measure:** If a unit of measure (e.g., PC, KG, EA, HRS, M, LBS) is specified alongside the quantity, include it.
            3.  **Concatenation/Formatting:** For multiple items, list each quantity and its unit. Combine these into a single string using a clear separator (e.g., a semicolon '; ' or newline '\\n').

            **Important Considerations for Extraction:**
            1.  **Completeness:** Capture the full text of the payment terms as stated. This can include percentages, due dates relative to an event (e.g., 'Net 30 days', 'Due Upon Receipt'), or specific conditions like 'Letter of Credit'.

            **Important Considerations for Extraction:**
            1.  **Nature of Signature:** Determine if it's a handwritten signature (often an image, may be described as 'Signature present'), a digital signature mark, or a typed name of an individual authorized to sign. A typed company name in a footer is generally not considered a signature for this purpose unless explicitly stated as 'Authorized by [Company Name]'.

            **Important Considerations for Extraction:**
            1.  **Nature of Signature:** Determine if it's a handwritten signature, a digital signature mark, or a typed name of an individual clearly indicating acceptance or authorization on behalf of the buyer. A typed company name alone is generally not a signature unless part of an explicit acceptance statement.

**Task:** You are an AI Document Classification Specialist. Your objective is to meticulously analyze the provided document pages ({num_pages} pages) and accurately classify the document's primary type based on its intrinsic purpose, structural characteristics, and specific content elements. The document may consist of multiple pages that collectively form a single logical entity.

**Acceptable Document Types:**
{acceptable_types_str}
Strictly classify the document ONLY amongst the acceptable document types.

**Detailed Instructions for Classification:**

1.  **Holistic Review:** Conduct a comprehensive examination of all pages. Pay close attention to titles, headings, recurring phrases, specific keywords (see below), data tables (e.g., itemized goods, payment details), and the overall layout to discern the document's fundamental function.
2.  **Content and Keyword Analysis (Prioritize explicit titles and document structure):**
    * **INVOICE (Commercial, Proforma, Customs):**
        * **Primary Keywords/Titles:** Search for explicit titles like "Invoice", "Commercial Invoice", "Proforma Invoice", "Tax Invoice", "Customs Invoice", "Proforma", "PI".
        * **Supporting Keywords/Phrases:** "Fattura" (Italian), "Rechnung" (German), "Facture" (French), "Bill", "Statement of Charges". Documents titled "Order Confirmation", "Sales Contract", "Sales Order", "Sales Agreement", "Indent", "PO", "Purchase Order" can function as a **Proforma Invoice** if they provide full itemization, pricing, terms, and are used to initiate payment or L/C.
        * **Core Structural Elements:**
            * A unique "Invoice Number" or "Reference Number".
            * Clear identification of "Seller" (or "Shipper", "Exporter", "Beneficiary", "From") and "Buyer" (or "Consignee", "Importer", "Bill To", "To") with names and addresses.
            * Itemized list of goods or services: descriptions, quantities, unit prices, line totals.
            * A "Total Amount Due", "Grand Total", or similar aggregate financial sum.
            * An "Invoice Date" or "Date of Issue" (a Proforma might use an "Order Date" or "Proforma Date").
            * Payment terms (e.g., "Net 30", "Advance Payment") and often bank details for payment.
        * **Differentiation:**
            * **Commercial Invoice:** Typically a definitive bill for goods already shipped or services rendered; requests payment for a completed transaction part.
            * **Proforma Invoice:** A preliminary quotation or bill issued *before* goods shipment or service completion. Used for buyer to arrange financing (like L/C), make a prepayment, or for customs pre-clearance. Often explicitly titled "Proforma Invoice".
            * **Customs Invoice:** Specifically formatted for customs authorities, detailing goods for import/export, including values, HS codes, country of origin, package details, for duty assessment.
    * **CRL (Customer Request Letter) / Application:**
        * **Primary Keywords/Titles:** "Request Letter", "Application for [Bank Product/Service]", "Letter of Instruction", "Remittance Application", "Import Payment Request".
        * **Supporting Keywords/Phrases:** Addressed "To The Manager, [Bank Name]", phrases like "We request you to...", "Kindly process the remittance for...", "Please debit our account...", "Letter of Undertaking".
        * **Content Focus:** Formal, written instruction from a customer (Applicant) to their bank. Explicitly requests the bank to perform a financial transaction (e.g., "issue a Letter of Credit", "remit funds for import", "process an outward remittance", "make an advance payment"). Contains details of the transaction: amount, currency, purpose, beneficiary name and bank details. Applicant's account to be debited is usually specified. Often includes declarations and signature of the applicant.
        * **Parties:** Clearly identifies an "Applicant" (customer) and a "Beneficiary" (recipient of funds).
3.  **Primary Purpose Determination:** Based on the collective evidence from all pages (explicit titles being a strong indicator), the presence/absence of key fields, and the characteristic markers outlined above, ascertain which single "Acceptable Document Type" most accurately represents the *overall primary purpose* of the document. What is the document's core function or the action it is intended to facilitate?
4.  **Confidence Assessment:** Assign a confidence score based on the clarity and preponderance of evidence.
    * **High Confidence (0.90-1.00):** An explicit, unambiguous title matching an acceptable type (e.g., "COMMERCIAL INVOICE") AND the presence of most core fields/structural elements characteristic of that type. The document's purpose is very clear.
    * **Medium Confidence (0.70-0.89):** The title might be generic (e.g., just "INVOICE" where it could be Commercial or Proforma) or the type is inferred (e.g., a Purchase Order acting as a Proforma Invoice based on its content). Core fields and structure strongly suggest a particular type, but some ambiguity or deviation exists. Or, a clear title but some expected key elements are missing or unclear.
    * **Low Confidence (0.50-0.69):** Title is ambiguous, misleading, or absent. Content could align with multiple types, or is missing several key indicators for any single type, making classification difficult.
    * **Very Low/Unknown (0.0-0.49):** Document does not appear to match any of the acceptable types based on available indicators, or is too fragmented/illegible for reliable classification.
5.  **Output Format (Strict Adherence Required):**
    * Return ONLY a single, valid JSON object.
    * The JSON object must contain exactly three keys: `"classified_type"`, `"confidence"`, and `"reasoning"`.
    * `"classified_type"`: The determined document type string. This MUST be one of the "Acceptable Document Types". If, after thorough analysis, the document does not definitively match any acceptable type based on the provided indicators, use "UNKNOWN".
    * `"confidence"`: A numerical score between 0.0 and 1.0 (e.g., 0.95).
    * `"reasoning"`: A concise but specific explanation for your classification. Reference explicit titles, key terms found (or absent), presence/absence of core fields, or structural elements that led to your decision (e.g., "Document explicitly titled 'PROFORMA INVOICE' on page 1. Contains seller/buyer, itemized goods with prices, total value, and payment terms. Serves as a preliminary bill for payment initiation."). If 'UNKNOWN', explain why (e.g., "Lacks clear title and key invoice fields like invoice number or distinct buyer/seller sections. Appears to be an internal statement not matching defined types.").

**Example Output:**
```json
{{
  "classified_type": "PROFORMA_INVOICE",
  "confidence": 0.98,
  "reasoning": "Document exhibits all core characteristics of a proforma invoice: details seller and buyer, lists specific goods with quantities and unit prices leading to a total amount, specifies payment terms ('50% advance...'), and indicates 'Ship Date TBD'. While not explicitly titled 'Proforma Invoice', its structure and content align perfectly with its function as a preliminary bill for initiating payment, akin to a sales order formatted for external use."

EXTRACTION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
**Your Role:** You are a highly meticulous and accurate AI Document Analysis Specialist. Your primary function is to extract structured data from business documents precisely according to instructions, with an extreme emphasis on the certainty, verifiability, and contextual appropriateness of every character and field extracted.

**Task:** Analyze the provided {num_pages} pages, which together constitute a single logical '{doc_type}' document associated with Case ID '{case_id}'. Carefully extract the specific data fields listed below. Use the provided detailed descriptions to understand the context, meaning, typical location, expected format, and potential variations of each field within this document type. Consider all pages to find the most relevant and accurate information. Pay close attention to nuanced instructions, including differentiation between similar concepts and rules for inference or default values if specified.

**Fields to Extract (Name and Detailed Description):**
{field_list_str}

**Output Requirements (Strict):**

1.  **JSON Only:** You MUST return ONLY a single, valid JSON object as your response. Do NOT include any introductory text, explanations, summaries, apologies, or any other text outside of the JSON structure. The response must start directly with `{{` and end with `}}`.
2.  **JSON Structure:** The JSON object MUST have keys corresponding EXACTLY to the field **names** provided in the "Fields to Extract" list above. STRICTLY MAKE SURE IT IS A VALID JSON WITH NO EXTRA QUOTES, COMMAS, SPECIAL CHARACTERS ETC. AND CAN BE PARSED PROGRAMATICALLY BY A PARSER.
3.  **Field Value Object:** Each value associated with a field key MUST be another JSON object containing the following three keys EXACTLY:
    * `"value"`: The extracted text value for the field.
        * If the field is clearly present, extract the value with absolute precision, ensuring every character is accurately represented and free of extraneous text/formatting (unless the formatting is part of the value, like a specific date format if ISO conversion is not possible).
        * If the field is **not found** or **not applicable** after thoroughly searching all pages and considering contextual clues as per the field description, use the JSON value `null` (not the string "null").
        * If multiple potential values exist (e.g., different addresses for a seller), select the one most pertinent to the field's specific context (e.g., 'Seller Address' for invoice issuance vs. 'Seller Corporate HQ Address' if the field specifically asks for that). Document ambiguity in reasoning.
        * For amounts, extract numerical values (e.g., "15000.75", removing currency symbols or group separators like commas unless they are part of a regional decimal format that must be preserved). Currency is typically a separate field.
        * For dates, if possible and certain, convert to ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD). If conversion is uncertain due to ambiguous source format (e.g., "01/02/03"), extract as it appears and note the ambiguity and original format in the reasoning.
        * For multi-line addresses, concatenate lines into a single string, typically separated by a comma and space (e.g., "123 Main St, Anytown, ST 12345, Country").

    * `"confidence"`: **Granular Character-Informed, Contextual, and Source-Aware Confidence Score (Strict)**
        * **Core Principle:** The overall confidence score (float, 0.00 to 1.00, recommend 2 decimal places) for each field MUST reflect the system's certainty about **every single character** of the extracted value, AND the **contextual correctness and verifiability** of that extraction. It's a holistic measure.
        * **Key Factors Influencing Confidence:**
            1.  **OCR Character Quality & Ambiguity:** Clarity and sharpness of each character (machine-print vs. handwriting). Low confidence for ambiguous characters (e.g., '0'/'O', '1'/'l'/'I', '5'/'S') unless context makes it near-certain.
            2.  **Handwriting Legibility:** Clarity, consistency, and formation of handwritten characters.
            3.  **Field Format Adherence:** How well the extracted value matches the expected data type and pattern (e.g., all digits for an account number, valid date structure, correct SWIFT code pattern). Deviations drastically lower confidence.
            4.  **Label Presence & Quality:** Was the value found next to a clear, standard, unambiguous label matching the field description? (e.g., "Invoice No.:" vs. inferring from a poorly labeled column). Explicit, standard labels lead to higher confidence.
            5.  **Positional Predictability:** Was the field found in a common, expected location for that document type versus an unusual one?
            6.  **Contextual Plausibility & Consistency:** Does the value make sense for the field and in relation to other extracted fields? (e.g., a 'Latest Shipment Date' should not be before an 'Order Date'). Cross-validation (e.g., amount in words vs. numeric amount) consistency is key.
            7.  **Completeness of Information:** If a field expects multiple components (e.g., full address) and parts are missing/illegible, this reduces confidence for the entire field.
            8.  **Source Document Quality:** Overall document clarity, scan quality, skew, rotation, background noise, stamps/markings obscuring text.
            9.  **Inference Level:** Was the value directly extracted or inferred? Higher degrees of inference lower confidence.

        * **Confidence Benchmarks (Stricter & More Granular):**
            * **0.99 - 1.00 (Very High/Near Certain):** All characters perfectly clear, machine-printed, unambiguous. Value from an explicit, standard label in a predictable location. Perfect format match. Contextually validated and sound. No plausible alternative interpretation. (Example: A clearly printed Invoice Number next to "Invoice No.:" label).
            * **0.95 - 0.98 (High):** Characters very clear and legible (excellent machine print or exceptionally neat handwriting). Minor, non-ambiguity-inducing visual imperfections. Strong label or unmistakable positional/contextual evidence. Correct format. Contextually valid. (Example: A clearly printed total amount next to "Grand Total:").
            * **0.88 - 0.94 (Good):** Generally clear, but minor, identifiable factors prevent higher scores:
                * One or two characters with slight ambiguity resolved with high confidence by context or pattern.
                * Very clean, legible, and consistent handwriting.
                * Information reliably extracted from structured tables with clear headers.
                * Minor print defects (slight fading/smudging) not obscuring character identity.
            * **0.75 - 0.87 (Moderate):** Value is legible and likely correct, but there are noticeable issues affecting certainty for some characters/segments, or some level of inference was required:
                * Moderately clear handwriting with some variability or less common letter forms.
                * Slightly blurry, pixelated, or faded print requiring careful interpretation for several characters.
                * Value inferred from contextual clues or non-standard labels with reasonable, but not absolute, certainty. (e.g., identifying a "Beneficiary Bank" from a block of payment text without an explicit label).
            * **0.60 - 0.74 (Low):** Significant uncertainty. Parts of the value are an educated guess, or the source is challenging:
                * Poor print quality (significant fading, widespread smudging, pixelation) affecting key characters.
                * Difficult or messy handwriting for a substantial portion of the value.
                * High ambiguity for several characters or critical segments where context provides only weak support. Value inferred with significant assumptions or from unclear/damaged source text.
            * **< 0.60 (Very Low / Unreliable):** Extraction is highly speculative or impossible to perform reliably. Value likely incorrect, incomplete, or based on guesswork. Text is largely illegible, critical characters are indecipherable, or contextual validation fails insurmountably.
        * If `"value"` is `null` (field not found/applicable), `"confidence"` MUST be `0.0`.

    * `"reasoning"`: A concise but specific explanation justifying the extracted `value` and the assigned `confidence` score. This is crucial for auditability and improvement.
        * Specify *how* the information was identified (e.g., "Directly beside explicit label 'Invoice No.' on page 1.", "Inferred from the 'BILL TO:' address block on page 2 as buyer's name.", "Calculated sum of all line item totals from table on page 3.").
        * Indicate *where* it was found (e.g., "Page 1, top right section.", "Page 3, under table column 'Description'.", "Page 5, section titled 'Payment Instructions'.").
        * **Mandatory for any confidence score below 0.99:** Briefly explain the *primary factors* leading to the reduced confidence. Reference specific issues:
            * Character ambiguity: "Value is 'INV-O012B'; Confidence 0.78: Second char 'O' could be '0', last char 'B' could be '8'; document slightly blurred in this area."
            * Print/Scan Quality: "Value '123 Main Street'; Confidence 0.85: Slight fading on 'Street', making 'S' and 't' less than perfectly sharp."
            * Handwriting: "Value 'Johnathan Doe'; Confidence 0.70: First name legible but 'Johnathan' has an unclear 'h' and 'n'; 'Doe' is clear."
            * Inference/Labeling: "Value 'Global Exporters Inc.'; Confidence 0.90: Inferred as Seller Name from prominent placement in header, no explicit 'Seller:' label."
            * Formatting Issues: "Value '15/07/2024'; Confidence 0.92: Date format DD/MM/YYYY clearly extracted; slight ink bleed around numbers."
            * Contextual Conflict: "Value for 'Net Weight' is '1500 KG', but 'Gross Weight' is '1400 KG'; Confidence 0.60 for Net Weight due to inconsistency requiring review."
        * If confidence is 0.99-1.00, reasoning can be succinct, e.g., "All characters perfectly clear, machine-printed, explicit standard label, contextually validated."
        * If `"value"` is `null`, briefly explain *why* (e.g., "No field labeled 'HS Code' or any recognizable tariff code found on any page.", "The section for 'Intermediary Bank Details' was present but explicitly marked 'Not Applicable'.").
